# ChainIntel-Hub
Cross-Chain Intelligence Platform

## Overview
ChainIntel Hub is an AI-powered swarm intelligence platform built on JuliaOS that provides real-time insights, opportunities, and risk assessments across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## Key Features
- AI Agent Swarms: Trust-weighted consensus and hierarchical coordination
- Cross-Chain Monitoring: Real-time data from Solana, Ethereum, Polygon
- Anomaly Detection: Statistical Z-score-based anomaly detection
- Opportunity Optimization: RL-driven arbitrage and yield farming
- REST API: Expose insights via `/api` endpoints
- React Dashboard: Dynamic UI with live visualizations

## JuliaOS Integration
- `agent.useLLM()` for intelligent analysis
- Hierarchical swarm coordination with trust weights
- Onchain data integration via Solana adapters
- Real-time data pipelines with Observables
